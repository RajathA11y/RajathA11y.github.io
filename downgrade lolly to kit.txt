You should now have stock Android 4.4.4 on your phone. Please be advised that some users (including me) have experienced screen flickering after downgrade. I rebooted the phone and the flickering was gone. But your experience may vary.

Salam, Mr. Hafiz, my problem is that I was playing a game at my Moto G XT1033 (v5.0.1). Then suddenly the screen got stuck, i turned it off then when I turned it on, it got stuck on Logo screen. Since, I didn’t liked lollipop so then I tried to downgrade to 4.4.4. For that. I followed your procedure word to word, but, in the end I am still STUCKED on the “M” logo of lollipop (it seems that it didn’t downgraded though)…… sometime, I’m stuck on “WARNING BOOTLOADER UNLOCKED” screen……………….I already made my backup before…… PLZZZZ, help me, Tell me what to do…….. If u live in UAE, mention it……

The main reasons for being stuck at boot logo are: wrong kernel, partition mismatch. You should try flashing the Lollipop build again to see if the problem persists.

You may have to factory reset the smartphone. I myself faced this same issue where the phone got stuck in blue logo screen. Some times wiping the partition cache may solve the issue or else factory reset in the only option. Try the steps in the following link to clear the cache/factory reset.
